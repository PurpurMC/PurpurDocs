# Installation instructions for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper and so on:
* Find your default world folder
* Place the datapack into the default world folder, in the 'datapacks' directory
* Restart the server

> Note: Datapacks cannot currently be separated per-world in Bukkit and forks. 

# Installation instructions for Vanilla minecraft:
* Open your save file
* Add the datapack to the datapack directory
* Restart the server

# Installation for modded minecraft:
There are mod versions available of these datapacks, which are functionally identical to the datapacks themselves.
The mod versions of the datapack will apply to any new world that is created while the mod is enabled. 
This makes it more useful for some cases, but not really for others. Datapacks can still be used in modded environments.

> Note: The mod version cannot be used on Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, Pufferfish, or Purpur servers
