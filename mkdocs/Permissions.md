Purpur adds a few new permission nodes for some of its added features.

By default, Purpur disables **all** of these permissions, no matter if a user has OP. Servers will need a permissions plugin such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/) to grant permissions to users.

## allow.ride.<mob_id&gt;
Requires enabling [`<mob_id>.ridable`](../Configuration#mobs) in purpur.yml

- This permission gives the ability to ride a certain mob by shift
right-clicking it. Once mounted you can use WASD to move around, and spacebar to jump or fly. Just replace "<mob_id&gt;" with the mob's Entity ID.

- **examples**:
    - `allow.ride.cow`
    - `allow.ride.zombie_pigman`
    - `allow.ride.snow_golem`

## allow.special.<mob_id&gt;
Requires enabling [`<mob_id>.ridable`](../Configuration#mobs) in purpur.yml

special ability. Not all mobs have a special ability. Just replace "<mob_id&gt;" with
the mob's Entity ID.

        - Ignites when spacebar is pressed
